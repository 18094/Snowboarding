            <h1>Snowboard shapes</h1>
            <p>There are different shapes for snowboards, and these shapes can affect the way that boards are riden down the mountain so understanding these shapes is a good idea. Although there are some more different shapes out there, these are the most common ones that will be encountered.</p>

        <div class="div2"><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="Images/directional.webp"><p style="padding-right: 1%; font-size: 23px; margin: 0%;">Directional</p>
            <p>These profiles are most often found in freeride and powder boards but can often be ridden all-mountain as well. They are often stiffer in the tail with a wider and softer nose that helps you stay afloat in powder and maintain stability while carving at high speeds. Typically, these boards have binding inserts that are set back (closer to the tail) sometimes up to an inch.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="div3"><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="Images/directional twin.webp"><p style="padding-left: 2%; font-size: 23px; margin: 0%;">Directional twin</p>
        <p>A combination of twin and directional snowboards, directional twins are a mix of both shapes. A symmetrical shape (similar size tip and tail) combined with a directional core (softer tip than tail) is common, as is the opposite: a directional shape but symmetrical core. Directional twins are most at home on all-mountain and freestyle terrain.</p>

        <p>One of the most popular shapes in the world of snowboarding, this shape can be identified by an equal tip and tail with and silhouette. These boards are ideal for all-mountain riders, beginners, and those who expect to be riding switch.</p>

                Burton Instigator
            <br>
            <br>
    The Instigator is a great board to get your snowboard learning underway and whilst you’ll probably want to upgrade once you’ve surpassed the intermediate phase, it can take you into any type of riding you would want to go, such is it's versatility.

            Salomon Sight
        <br>
        <br>
        The 2023 Sight is quite a different board from it's predecessors. It went through quite an overhaul. It's now what I would consider a mellow freeride board (on of two freeride options in this list, the other one being the Burton Ripcord) where previously I categorized it as an all-mountain board. So, if you're looking to take on freeriding/powder early in your snowboarding life, but want a board that won't be too hard to ride, then the Sight is a great option.

        Rossignol Evader
    <br>
    <br>
    The Evader has a very friendly camber profile, a nice and easy soft flex and provides a very versatile ride that allows you to progress into which ever area of snowboarding you want.

    Nidecker Play
<br>
<br>
The Play is a great option for anyone new to snowboarding. It combines a friendly flat-to-rocker profile, an easy going flex and friendly price-tag. Not only that, but it's also nice and versatile, allowing you to go in whatever direction you want to go with your snowboarding progression.

    YES Basic
<br>
<br>
The YES Basic is a great little freestyle board that is also well suited to beginners. It has a nice forgiving medium-soft flex, is easy to turn on but still feels very stable underfoot. It’s a great option for those that often ride in harder or icy conditions, is very versatile and is a board that can take you beyond the beginner stage and even beyond the intermediate stage, if you're riding takes a freestyle dominant path.
