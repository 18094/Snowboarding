            <h1>Safety Equipment</h1>
            <p>There are several pieces of other equipment which can help keep a rider safe and also just make the experience even more fun. Common equipment (apart from the essentials for actually snowboarding) includes; helmets, wrist guards, knee pads, goggles and golves. You will also need warm clothes to go with these, the reasons for this should be fairly obvious (keeping yourself warm).</p>

                Helmet
            <br>
            <br>
            Wear a helmet! Hitting your head is bad, concussions are bad so wearing a helmet is a no brainer. When buying a helmet make sure it fits well, is properly adjusted and doesn’t move around on your head.

            Wrist guard
        <br>
        <br>
        
        Wrist guards are definitely a good idea if you’re just starting out snowboarding. As anyone who has ever spent more than 5 minutes on a snowboard will tell you – catching edges can really ruin your day! Catching your toe edge means falling forward and this can easily result in a sprained wrist. Wrist guards help prevent this and make sure you enjoy your time on the slopes.

        Knee pads
    <br>
    <br>
    There are two ways people tend to fall when they catch their toes edge: either onto their wrists or onto their knees. If you’re a ‘knee faller’ then you’ll be needing a set of knee pads! Especially when conditions are a bit icy knee pads are a great idea and can save from bruised knees from even the smallest of falls.

        Goggles
    <br>
    <br>
    
    If you’re going to be up on the mountain all day then it’s really important to protect your eyes. On the snow the effect of the sun’s UV rays is made worse by the reflection back off the snow. Although you can wear sunglasses on a sunny day they are no good if the weather turns bad and it starts to snow. Having little snowflakes bounce off your eyeballs kind of makes it harder to see where you’re going, so it’s best to opt for goggles.

        Gloves / Mittens
    <br>
    <br>
    Gloves or mittens are essential items which every snowboarder need. They not only protect your hands from the cold, they also protect you from the snow in an event of a fall. Snow and ice can produce pretty nasty ice burns or cuts.So even in the spring when the weather is warm you definitely need some gloves, especially when you are learning.
