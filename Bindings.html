            <h1>Bindings</h1>
            <p>For snowboard bindings, there are three main tyepes. These include; two-strap bindings which are considered the standard or common binding type, rear entry bindings and step on bindings. Unlike the snowboard where your choice will impact how you ride, bindings can be a completely personal choice as they don't effect the way or how you ride a snowboard.</p>

                Two-strap
            <br>
            <br>
            Two-Strap bindings have been the standard binding used for ages because they are not only easy to use but also secure and responsive. Simply slide your foot in place and tighten the straps to secure yourself in. One pro is that these bindings can be very lightweight. A major con is that it may take some time to secure and may require sitting down to tighten, depending on your skill level and surrounding terrain.

            Rear Entry
        <br>
        <br>
        
Rear Entry bindings feature a high back and typically have a strap at the ankle or toe. To put these bindings on you, pop open the high back, slide your foot into place, and then shut the high back. The benefit to this style is that they are much quicker to get into vs. the traditional two-strap. They make this an awesome option when you normally ride with other skiers who taunt you for strapping in at the top of each run. The downside is that they can often be a little on the heavier side.

        Step On
    <br>
    <br>
    Step On® bindings are unique to only Burton and also require Step On® compatible snowboard boots. This binding functions exactly how its’ name sounds. To enter these bindings, you simply slide your boot in and then click your heel into place. These bindings are the lightest and fastest snowboard bindings on the market today. They are great for beginners, people with back or knee injuries, or for boarders who want the best performance. Because the bindings and boots must be compatible, the only drawback to them is that they often cost the most.
