            <h1>Boots</h1>
            <p>Much like bindings, boots have the freedom of choice in what you prefer. There are 3 different options for boot types, there are Tradtional laced boots, Speed laced boots and BOA laced boots. There is an exception to this though, if you were to get step on bindings then you don't have as much choice as you will need step on boots as well.</p>

        <div class="div2"><img style="max-width: 80%;" src="Images/22282100001_1.jpeg"><p style="padding-right: 1%; font-size: 23px; margin: 0%;">Traditional</p>
            <p>The traditional laces are the trusted and proven lacing system most snowboarders still wear today. The laces are replaceable with performance enhanced laces offering more flexibility, comfort, and security. </p>

        <div class="div3"><img style="max-width: 80%;" src="Images/22950100001_1.jpeg"><p style="padding-left: 2%; font-size: 23px; margin: 0%;">Quick-pull</p>
        <p>It is named quick-pull because you can conveniently pull a single lace to tighten up the entire lacing system. It has a corset-like design and system, which can easily and quickly tighten the zones in just a single pull. It means you can adjust the lacing system properly as well as its tightness even if you wear gloves or mittens. </p>

        <div class="div4"><img style="max-width: 80%;" src="Images/20317100001_1.jpeg"><p style="padding-left: 2%; font-size: 23px; margin: 0%;">BOA</p>
        <p>This type of lacing system for Snowboard boots has a small-diameter cable, most commonly made from stainless steel strands. They are attached to either single or double knurled dials or wheels as the adjustable mechanism to provide the user with a snuggly fit. Some use two dials on the bootâ€™s top portion and the ankle portion.
